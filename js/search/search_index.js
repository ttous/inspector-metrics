interface to track report-timestamps and -values of metric instances.\nThis is directly linked to the minimum-reporting timeout of the BaseReporter,\nwhich ensures that a certain value gets reported at least in a certain amount of time\ne.g. every minute without the value having changed. And on the other hand\nto not report / include values that haven't changed.\nAn example for this is the health status of an application (a gauge: 1 means healthy, 0 means unhealthy)\nwhich you normally want to report every minute for your graphs but should not\nnecessarily be included in every reporting run with the same value.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                        lastReport\n                                \n                                \n                                        lastValue\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        lastReport\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        lastReport:     number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    timestamp of the latest report.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        lastValue\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        lastValue:     number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    value that got reported as latest.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        import \"source-map-support/register\";\n\n/**\n * Utility interface to track report-timestamps and -values of metric instances.\n * This is directly linked to the minimum-reporting timeout of the {@link BaseReporter},\n * which ensures that a certain value gets reported at least in a certain amount of time\n * e.g. every minute without the value having changed.

many time was my function called, number of bookings in a sales system\")\nMonotoneCounter - a monotonically increasing integer value (e.g. \"error count\")\nEvent - ad-hoc event to report events (e.g. \"application start / deployment\", \"batch import started / ended\")\nGauge - measurement of a value (e.g. \"number of waiting threads on a resource\")\nHdrHistogram - recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable integer value range with configurable value precision\nHistogram - measures the statistical distribution of all values\nMeter - measures the rate of events over time (e.g. \"requests per second\")\nTimer - measures call-rate of a function and the distribution of the duration of all calls\n\nThere are libraries which collect some metrics:\n\nnode VM - collects memory & garbage collection metric for node VM\n\nThe library ships with a default console MetricReporter.\nSome other reporter:\n\nCarbon / Graphite\nCSV\nElasticsearch\nInflux\nPrometheus / Pushgateway\n\nimport { LoggerReporter, MetricRegistry, Timer } from \"inspector-metrics\";\n\n// a registry is a collection of metric objects\nconst
