\"number of waiting threads on a resource\")\nHdrHistogram - recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable integer value range with configurable value precision\nHistogram - measures the statistical distribution of all values\nMeter - measures the rate of events over time (e.g. \"requests per second\")\nTimer - measures call-rate of a function and the distribution of the duration of all calls\n\nThe library ships with a default console MetricReporter.\nSome other reporter:\n\nCarbon / Graphite\nCSV\nElasticsearch\nInflux\nPrometheus / Pushgateway\n\nimport {
